Experimental python interface to CRTM
* build CRTM source in CRTM_REL-2.2.3 (compile with -fPIC!)
* optionally set env vars CRTM_LIBDIR (location of libcrtm.a) and CRTM_INCDIR (location of CRTM *.mod files). 
  If not set, CRTM_REL-2.2.3/libsrc will be used for both.
* run 'python setup.py build_ext --inplace'
* run test.py (you will have to edit and change crtm_coeffs_path).


Fortran wrapper to CRTM that uses iso_c_binding is in src/pycrtm_interface.f90.
Cython wrapper to pycrtm_interface.f90 in crtm_interface.pyx (uses src/pycrtm_interface.h).
Python test program that imports crtm_interface c extension and calls init function in test.py.

TODO:  
* add rest of functionality in GSI's crtm_interface.f90 in pycrtm_interface.f90.
* add high-level python interface to functions in crtm_interface.pyx.
